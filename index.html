<h3>About this site</h3>
<p>This site is designed to show material learned in CSCI1100, and to showcase certain tricks and techniques I have learned as a Web Developer. This site is designed to be
completely responsively themed, meaning that the site will be completely usable on any device and resizable to any width and height without sacrificing much aesthetic value 
or ease of use.
