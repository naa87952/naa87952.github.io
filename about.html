<div class="about-left">
<h3>Experience</h3>
<p> I have been programming as a web developer with the University of Georgia's Information Technology Outreach Services for a little over 3 years. My notable projects include
work on various UGA websites as well as database management and data manipulation for client projects. I am versed in PHP, SQL, CSS, HTML, and Java, and have several years of experience in technical support.
I am fluent in the use of Drupal as a content management system, and am comfortable with theming and structure work therein.</p>
<h3>Previous Education</h3>
Before attending the University of Georgia, I attended Oconee County High school. During my time at Oconee, my interest in Computer Science was peaked, and I made the decision to be become a Computer
Science Major. However, I recently decided that the theory involved with the Computer Science program was not a good fit, and have since changed my major to Intended Management Information Systems.
